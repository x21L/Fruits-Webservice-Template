# Fruit Webservice

The servlet is available under:
~~~shell
http://localhost:8080/Fruits/FruitServlet
~~~

Your API must have at least the following functions:

* get all fruits
* insert a new fruit
* delete a fruit
* get all fruits by a parameter. E.g. all green fruits
* error messages by wrong parameters

> You should also send a response when inserting something. The client must know if it 
worked or not.


Feel free to implement private helper methods, equals methods and so on as you like.
Maybe you will also need a fruit controller. Fruit helper methods should **not** be 
in the servlet. 

If you like you can also add more servlets.
